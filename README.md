```bash
npm install
```

**Note:** You must request from [King](https://github.com/KanadeTachie) to change the backend to redirect to localhost,
else the fork will execute with its websites redirecting to the production link instead.

Code documenation will be released in the future. In the mean time, check the code contents itself as it contains
comments on how the code works and what was changed. Or ask the devs themselves.
